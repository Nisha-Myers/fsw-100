        <h2>Why the Universal Health system?</h2>
        
        <article>
            <h3>Because Healthcare is a Human Right!</h3>
            <p>The U.S. ranks last on access to care, administrative efficiency, equity, 
               and health care outcomes, but second on measures of care process. 
               <b>1 in 10</b> people in the U.S. don't have access to healthcare. In fact, 
               deaths from lack of health insurance now exceed those caused by many other 
               common causes of death... such as <i>kidney disease</i>. In 2019 a Gallup poll found 
               that <b>25%</b> of Americans said they or a family member have delayed medical
               treatment for a serious illness due to the costs of medical care. An additional 
               <b>8%</b> reported delaying medical treatment for less serious illnesses. In 2019, 
               <b>73.7%</b> of uninsured adults stated that they were uninsured because the 
               cost of coverage was too high. Thanks to the ACA, in 2016, the amount of Americans 
               decreased by nearly <b>20 million</b>! Yet to this day, <b>12 states</b> still 
               refuse to expand Medicaid. No matter how much it would help their citizens. These
               states include: <i>WY, SD, KS, TX, WI, TN, MS, AL, GA, FL, NC, & SC.</i>
               All of which, unsurprisingly, are Republican led states. 
               During Trumps Presidency, the number of uninsured Americans jumped by 
               <b>23 million</b>, which led to thousands more deaths. Lack of insurance 
               leads to a <b>40%</b> greater risk of death in this country... a rather extreme 
               increase from 1993.</p>

             <p>Medicaid, the closest this country has come to Universal Healthcare... While with Universal healthcare,
                or (UHC) every. single. citizen. is provided with quality healthcare regardless of ones ability to pay
                or what state ones lucky enough to live in. The care is made possible by everyones contribution, by
                paying a little higher taxes than we do here. Which, most people, in most countries, are more than happy
                to pay if it helps their fellow citizens. Sadly, we don't live in a country like that, in fact, we're 
                probably the most selfish of all "advanced" countries on this planet in my humble opinion. We unfortunately 
                live in a country where a person in need is spat at & told "I'm not paying for YOUR healthcare! That's MY 
                money! You could die for all I care!!!". Something I can unfortunately attest to, as I've spent a lot of 
                time on political sites... It breaks my heart every time I see something like that. But I digress... The UHC 
                model allows for even a homeless individual to be provided with much needed healthcare. Which sometimes is 
                precisely what they need to pull themselves out of the streets. The majority of progressive countries have 
                incorporated UHC... These coutries include: <i>Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
                Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Isle of Man, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Norway, Poland, 
                Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.</i> 
             </p>

                <p>The incorporation of the Universal Health system has substantially increased their estimated lifespan. 
                   The U.S. rates <b>29th</b> in the world for citizen life expectancy. While citizens in countries with UHC
                   tend to live <b>80+</b> years! The U.S is the ONLY wealthy, industrialized nation IN THE WORLD without 
                   Universal Health Care & it's an absolute disgrace!

            <tr id="inner">
                <td id="td1">2018</td>
                <td>48,344</td>

            </tr>
        </table>
            <p>As you can see from the table above, even with a <b>35%</b> climb in suicide rates from 1999 
                to 2018, the rate of REPORTED deaths as a result of no healthcare seems to consistently 
                keep up. But <b>45,000</b> deaths annualy isn't even an exact number. We're also not sure 
                just how many of those sucides were due to the inability to obtain healthcare. </p>

            <h3>Lack of Healthcare</h3>
            <p> <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5501/week2/mental-illness.html">Your mental state</a> can be 
                negitively affected by overly expensive healthcare, or lack thereof. Leading to even 
                more problems in ones life... like job loss & poverty. Which only exacerbates the healthcare 
                aspect. Much like being incapable of purchasing a new matress before your old matress 
                causes long term back problems. Or being capable of buying a filling for a cavity, can 
                lead to either losing the tooth, or even worse... an abcess. I personally know a family 
                who lost a loved one as a result of an abcess he was too poor to afford to fix. Simply
                put, lack of healthcare impedes a persons ability to recieve the care they need when, they 
                need it!!!</p>

        <h3>In Summation...</h3>
        <P>Everyone deserves access to proper healthcare. We shouldn't have to break ourselves to be relieved of pain. Whether
           it be physical or mental. The cost of living is far too high as it is. We have to pay our taxes, pay for water, pay 
           for heat, pay for AC, pay for food, pay for gas, pay for our transportation constantly even if we've already bought 
           it (the same goes for housing & our phones), pay for school, pay for clothes, pay for hygenic products to stay clean 
           & socially acceptable, pay for internet, & more... With ALL of this, with everything we're forced to buy constantly 
           just to get by, why should we have to pay money we don't have on something every. single. person. NEEDS!?!? 
        </P>
