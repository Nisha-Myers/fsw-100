        <h2>Why the Universal Health system?</h2>
        
        <article>
            <h3>Because Healthcare is a Human Right!</h3>
            <p>The U.S. ranks last on access to care, administrative efficiency, equity, 
               and health care outcomes, but second on measures of care process. 
               <b>1 in 10</b> people in the U.S. don't have access to healthcare. In fact, 
               deaths from lack of health insurance now exceed those caused by many other 
               common causes of death... such as <i>kidney disease</i>. In 2019 a Gallup poll found 
               that <b>25%</b> of Americans said they or a family member have delayed medical
               treatment for a serious illness due to the costs of medical care. An additional 
               <b>8%</b> reported delaying medical treatment for less serious illnesses. In 2019, 
               <b>73.7%</b> of uninsured adults stated that they were uninsured because the 
               cost of coverage was too high.</p>

                <p>Thanks to the ACA, in 2016, the amount of Americans decreased by nearly 
                   <b>20 million</b>! Yet to this day, <b>12 states</b> still refuse to 
                   expand Medicaid. No matter how much it would help their citizens. These
                   states include: <i>WY, SD, KS, TX, WI, TN, MS, AL, GA, FL, NC, & SC.</i>
                   All of which, unsurprisingly, are Republican led states.
                   During Trumps Presidency, the number of uninsured Americans jumped by 
                   <b>23 million</b>, which led to thousands more deaths. Lack of insurance 
                   leads to a <b>40%</b> greater risk of death in this country. A rather extreme 
                   increase from 1993.</p>

            <tr id="inner">
                <td id="td1">2018</td>
                <td>48,344</td>
                <td>about</td>
            </tr>
            <tr id="inner">
                <td id="td2">2019</td>
                <td>47,511</td>

                <td>EVERY year</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
            <p>As you can see from the table above, even with <b>35%</b> climb in suicide rates from 1999 
                to 2018, the rate of REPORTED deaths as a result of no healthcare seems to consistently 
                keep up. But <b>45,000</b> deaths annualy isn't even an exact number. We're also not sure 
                just how many of those sucides were due to the inability to obtain healthcare. </p>

            <h3>Lack of Healthcare</h3>
            <p> <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5501/week2/mental-illness.html">Your mental state</a> can be 
                negitively affected by overly expensive healthcare, or lack thereof. Leading to even 
                more problems in ones life... like job loss & poverty. Which only exacerbates the healthcare 
                aspect. Much like being incapable of purchasing a new matress before your old matress 
                causes long term back problems. Or being capable of buying a filling for a cavity, can 
                lead to either losing the tooth, or even worse... an abcess. I personally know a family 
                who lost a loved one as a result of an abcess he was too poor to afford to fix. Simply
                put, lack of healthcare impedes a persons ability to recieve the care they need when, they 
                need it!!!</p>
