            <h3>Because Healthcare is a Human Right!</h3>
            <p>The U.S. ranks last on access to care, administrative efficiency, equity, 
               and health care outcomes, but second on measures of care process. 
               <b>1 in 10</b> people in the U.S. don't have access to healthcare. In fact, 
               deaths from lack of health insurance now exceed those caused by many other 
               common causes of death... such as kidney disease. In 2019 a Gallup poll found 
               that <b>25%</b> of Americans said they or a family member have delayed medical
               treatment for a serious illness due to the costs of medical care. An additional 
               <b>8%</b> reported delaying medical treatment for less serious illnesses.</p>

            <h3>Lack of Healthcare</h3>
            <p> Overly expensive healthcare, or lack thereof can be exremely detrimental to ones 
                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5501/week2/mental-illness.html">mental state</a>, leading 
                to even more health problems... Like job loss & poverty. Much like being incapable of 
                prchasing a new matress before your old matress causes long term back problems. Or 
                being capable of buying a filling for a cavity, can lead to either losing the tooth, 
                or even worse... an abcess. I personally know a family who lost a loved one as a 
                result of an abcess he was too poor to afford to fix.</p>
