            <p style="color:indigo">Mental health, like physical health, is extremely important to our wellbeing 
                & quality of life. Perhaps even more important, because when one suffers from 
                mental illness, one tends to neglect their physical health. Something I, & 
                millions of others can attest to. But all too often, because of the social 
                stigmas surrounding mental illness, over <b>75% of people</b> are compelled 
                to neglect getting diagnosed or recieving the proper treatment, leading to obesity, poor hygiene, 
                poverty, death, & more. But it doesn't have to be this way, & it shouldn't be 
                this way. No one should be made to feel ashamed for something they have no 
                control over. Most of the time, peoples mental problems stem from <i>chemical imballances</i> 
                in the brain that are, at this point in time, treatable but not currable. Why should something 
                nearly <b>1 billion people</b> on earth live, & suffer with cause us to be ashamed?
                Two words, it shouldn't.</p>
