        <p>People from all over the world bring enormous benifits to our Country by way of our economy, 
        culture, & community. Liberals don't merely recognize the benifits of Immigration, they celebrate 
        them! They fight for effective policies that treat everyone with dignity & respect. Sadly, the 
        exremely negative rhetoric & policies from the Right that have broken our Immigration 
        system continue to increase in consistency & severity.</p>

                    <dt><b>1.)</b> They Defend Human Rights</dt>
                    <dd>As liberals, we continue to call on the our Government around the world to take a 
                        firm stand on the international community to defend human rights.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt><b>2.)</b> They Demand REAL Climate Action</dt>
                    <dd>Liberals have a lengthy record of environmental protection. Our natural environment
                        is precious & it's our duty to heal & protect it!  
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt><b>3.)</b> They Champion Democracy</dt>
                    <dd>The depressing truth of the state of Democracy around the world is that it is in terrible
                        danger! The United States "electing" a Dictator Sympathizer has only exacerbated the situation...
                        Trump coddled & cozied up to every Tyrannical, Authoritarian, Dictator he could get his hands on.
                        Emboldening the so called "Strong Men" of the world to increase their attacks on Democracy.<br>
                        But Liberals champion the Democratic rights of ALL individuals. They play a vital role in creating
                        a fairer, more equal world... And not just verbally, but through passionate ACTION!!!

                    <dd>Liberals don't just live for today. They don't want to live in the past... like some. They're always 
                        considering our tomorrow by way of our environment, technology, education, rights, & progression as a 
                        whole...

                    <dt><b>5.)</b> They Support Rebuilding Alliances</dt>
                    <dd>Liberals believe in working with our friends across the world to make our WORLD a better place
                        for all! Liberals see Nationalism as being selfish, & completely illogical. We have to work 
                        together if we ever want to move forward.

                    <dt><b>6.)</b> They Promote Equality</dt>
                    <dd>Liberalism means standing up for Human Rights!!! Believing that every. single. individual. 
                        deserves equal rights, freedom, & treament. Unfortunately, in too many countries, across the 
                        Globe, being LGBT+ or a woman means you don't have equal opportunities, or even basic Human 
                        Rights! But Liberals fight for those who aren't able, or allowed to fight for themselves!

                    <dd>
                        There is a creeping rise of Authoritarianismacross the Globe & something must be done to stop it! 
                        With Russia's disinformation campaign in 2016 that seems to have continued to spread & worsen by the 
                        day. Democracy seems to be hanging by a thread... & something must be done... NOW!!!

                    <dd>Perhaps Liberals most important role in the world today is speaking up for those who aren't able 
                        or allowed to speak up for themselves. Liberals have a long history of fighting to sevure safe &
