            <dl>                
                <dt><b>1.)</b> They Defend Human Rights</dt>
                <dd>As liberals, we continue to call on the our Government around the world to take a 
                    firm stand on the international community to defend human rights.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>2.)</b> They Demand REAL Climate Action</dt>
                <dd>Liberals have a lengthy record of environmental protection. Our natural environment
                    is precious & it's our duty to heal & protect it!  
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>3.)</b> They Champion Democracy</dt>
                <dd>The depressing truth of the state of Democracy around the world is that it is in terrible
                    danger! The United States "electing" a Dictator Sympathizer has only exacerbated the situation...
                    Trump coddled & cozied up to every Tyrannical, Authoritarian, Dictator he could get his hands on.
                    Emboldening the so called "Strong Men" of the world to increase their attacks on Democracy.<br>
                    But Liberals champion the Democratic rights of ALL individuals. They play a vital role in creating
                    a fairer, more equal world... And not just verbally, but through passionate ACTION!!!    
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>4.)</b> They Tackle the Challenges of Tomorrow</dt>
                <dd>Liberals don't just live for today. They don't want to live in the past... like some. They're always 
                    considering our tomorrow by way of our environment, technology, education, rights, & progression as a 
                    whole...  
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>5.)</b> They Support Rebuilding Alliances</dt>
                <dd>Liberals believe in working with our friends across the world to make our WORLD a better place
                    for all! Liberals see Nationalism as being selfish, & completely illogical. We have to work 
                    together if we ever want to move forward.
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>6.)</b> They Promote Equality</dt>
                <dd>Liberalism means standing up for Human Rights!!! Believing that every. single. individual. 
                    deserves equal rights, freedom, & treament. Unfortunately, in too many countries, across the 
                    Globe, being LGBT+ or a woman means you don't have equal opportunities, or even basic Human 
                    Rights! But Liberals fight for those who aren't able, or allowed to fight for themselves!
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>7.)</b> They Oppose Authoritarianism</dt>
                <dd>
                    There is a creeping rise of Authoritarianismacross the Globe & something must be done to stop it! 
                    With Russia's disinformation campaign in 2016 that seems to have continued to spread & worsen by the 
                    day. Democracy seems to be hanging by a thread... & something must be done... NOW!!! 
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>8.)</b> They Support Working With Our EU Partners</dt>
                <dd>Liberals are unapologetic about being compassionate internationalists. They care about our neightbors 
                    "across the lake" & will continue to do so.
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>9.)</b> They Try to Bring Compassion to the World</dt>
                <dd>Perhaps Liberals most important role in the world today is speaking up for those who aren't able 
                    or allowed to speak up for themselves. Liberals have a long history of fighting to sevure safe & 
                    legal routes to sanctuary for refugees... 
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>10.)</b> They Welcome the Benifits of Immigration</dt>
                <dd>People from all over the world bring enormous benifits to our Country by way of our economy, 
                    culture, & community. Liberals don't merely recognize the benifits of Immigration, they celebrate 
                    them! They fight for effective policies that treat everyone with dignity & respect. Sadly, the 
                    exremely negative rhetoric & policies from the Right that have broken our Immigration 
                    system continue to increase in consistency & severity.

                        <p>Modern liberalism now includes issues such as same-sex marriage, 
                            transgender rights, the abolition of capital punishment, reproductive 
                            & other women's rights, voting rights for all adult citizens, civil rights, 
                            environmental justice and government protection of the right to an adequate 
                            standard of living... But they've been striving & fighting for the expansion 
                            of civil & political rights for the sake of true freedom & the common good
                            for ages.

                            <b>Just a few of their accomplishments include:</b> <br>
                            The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was an ambitious employment & 
                            infrastructure program created by President Roosevelt in 1935 that lasted 
                            eight years, during the bleakest years of the Great Depression. <br>
                            The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, 
                            color, religion, sex or national origin. Provisions of this civil rights 
                            act forbade discrimination on the basis of sex, as well as, race in hiring, 
                            promoting, and firing. <br>
                            & finally.... <br>
                            The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination in public places, 
                            provided for the integration of schools and other public facilities, and made 
                            employment discrimination illegal. It was the most sweeping civil rights 
                            legislation since Reconstruction.

            <p>So, as you can see, the misconceptions surrounding the term "Liberal" & what these 
                kind individuals stand for, have simply been born from misplaced hatred & the increasingly 
                detrimental pandemic that is misinformation. Liberals are merely those who wish to 
                help their fellow human beings
