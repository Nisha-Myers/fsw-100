            <dl>                
                <dt><b>1.)</b> They Defend Human Rights...</dt>
                <dd>As liberals, we continue to call on the our Government around the world to take a 
                    firm stand on the international community to defend human rights.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>2.)</b> They Demand REAL Climate Action...</dt>
                <dd>Liberals have a lengthy record of environmental protection. Our natural environment
                    is precious & it's our duty to heal & protect it!  
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>3.)</b> They Champion Democracy...</dt>
                <dd>The depressing truth of the state of Democracy around the world is that it is in terrible
                    danger! The United States "electing" a Dictator Sympathizer has only exacerbated the situation...
                    Trump coddled & cozied up to every Tyrannical, Authoritarian, Dictator he could get his hands on.
                    Emboldening the so called "Strong Men" of the world to increase their attacks on Democracy.<br>
                    But Liberals champion the Democratic rights of ALL individuals. They play a vital role in creating
                    a fairer, more equal world... And not just verbally, but through passionate ACTION!!!    
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>4.)</b> They Tackle the Challenges of Tomorrow...</dt>
                <dd>Liberals don't just live for today. They don't want to live in the past... like some. They're always 
                    considering our tomorrow by way of our environment, technology, education, rights, & progression as a 
                    whole...  
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>5.)</b> They Support Rebuilding Alliances...</dt>
                <dd>Liberals believe in working with our friends across the world to make our WORLD a better place
                    for all! Liberals see Nationalism as being selfish, & completely illogical. We have to work 
                    together if we ever want to move forward.
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>6.)</b> They Promote Equality...</dt>
                <dd>Liberalism means standing up for Human Rights!!! Believing that every. single. individual. 
                    deserves equal rights, freedom, & treament. Unfortunately, in too many countries, across the 
                    Globe, being LGBT+ or a woman means you don't have equal opportunities, or even basic Human 
                    Rights! But Liberals fight for those who aren't able, or allowed to fight for themselves!
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>7.)</b> They Oppose Authoritarianism...</dt>
                <dd>There is a creeping rise of Authoritarianismacross the Globe & something must be done to stop it! 
                    With Russia's disinformation campaign in 2016 that seems to have continued to spread & worsen by the 
                    day. Democracy seems to be hanging by a thread... & something must be done... NOW!!! 
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>8.)</b> They Support Working With Our EU Partners...</dt>
                <dd>Liberals are unapologetic about being compassionate internationalists. They care about our neightbors 
                    "across the lake" & will continue to do so.
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>9.)</b> They Try to Bring Compassion to the World...</dt>
                <dd>Perhaps Liberals most important role in the world today is speaking up for those who aren't able 
                    or allowed to speak up for themselves. Liberals have a long history of fighting to sevure safe & 
                    legal routes to sanctuary for refugees...

                <br>
                <dt><b>10.)</b> They Welcome the Benifits of Immigration...</dt>
                <dd>People from all over the world bring enormous benifits to our Country by way of our economy, 
                    culture, & community. Liberals don't merely recognize the benifits of Immigration, they celebrate 
                    them! They fight for effective policies that treat everyone with dignity & respect. Sadly, the 
                    exremely negative rhetoric & policies from the Right that have broken our Immigration 
                    system continue to increase in consistency & severity.

    <div  class="why"><h1>So, why have Conservatives given Liberals such a bad name?</h1></div>
    <p>Well, to answer this question, lets begin with the year 1968, when a debate was held between 
        Liberal writer Gore Vidal & conservative thinker William F. Buckley. The hope was that these 
        two members of opposing intellectual elites could prove to Americans living through tumultuous 
        times, that political disagreements could in fact be civilized. Unfortunately, the hope for such 
        an outcome didn't last very long. Rather than being capable of working through their differences, 
        conservative Buckley & Liberal Vidal quickly descended into insults, & finally suing one another 
        for defamation.<br>   
        The story of the 1968 Vidal & Buckley debate opens a well regarded 2013 book titled "Predisposed" 
        that introduced the general public to the field of political neuroscience. The authors of this book 
        are a trio of political scientists at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln & Rice University. They argued 
        that "if the differences between Liberals and Conservatives seem profound and even unbridgeable, it is 
        because they are rooted in personality characteristics and biological predispositions." In other words, 
        a persons political standing is rooted in one's personality & biology...
    </p> 
    <p>
        Overall, their research showed that while Conservatives desire security, predictability, & authority... 
        Liberals are more comfortable with novelty, nuance, & complexity. Which in this authors opinion would 
        explain why Liberals & Conservatives have a completely different requirements when it comes to forming 
        an opinion on a particular situation. To put it simply: a Liberal is determined to know what beyond the 
        surface of the water, while a Conservative is content with skipping rocks across it.<br>       
        If you had hooked Vidal & Buckley up to a magnetic resonance imaging machine, & presented them with 
        identical images, you would likely have seen differences in their brain, especially in the areas that 
        process social and emotional information. The volume of Gray Matter, or Neural Cell Bodies, making up 
        the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (an area that helps detect errors and resolve conflicts) tends to be 
        larger in Liberals. And the amygdala (which is important for regulating emotions and evaluating threats) 
        is larger in Conservatives. Proving why Liberals tend to be empathetic & considerate, & Conservatives 
        are apathetic & self-serving.

        <b>If you spend any time consuming right-wing "news" or rather media in America, you'll quickly learn the following:</b>
        <br> 
        Liberals are supposedly responsible for <i>racism, slavery, and the Ku Klux Klan. They admire Mussolini and Hitler, and modern 
        liberalism is little different from fascism or, even worse, communism. The mainstream media and academia 
        cannot be trusted because of the pervasive, totalitarian nature of liberal culture.</i>
        <br><br> 
        This belief in a broad liberal conspiracy is standard in the highest echelons of the conservative 
        establishment & right-wing media. The Russia investigation is dismissed, from the president on down, as 
        a politicized witch hunt. George Soros supposedly paid $300 to each participant in the “March for Our Lives” 
        in March. (Disclosure: I marched that day, and I’m still awaiting my check.) What is less well appreciated 
        by liberals is that the language of conspiracy is often used to justify similar behavior on the right. The 
        Russia investigation is not just a witch hunt, it’s the product of the real scandal, which is 
        Hillary-Russia-Obama-FBI collusion, so we must investigate that. Soros funds paid campus protestors, so 
        Turning Point USA needs millions of dollars from Republican donors to win university elections. The liberal 
        academic establishment prevents conservative voices from getting plum faculty jobs, so the Koch Foundation 
        needs to give millions of dollars to universities with strings very much attached.
        This did not begin with Donald Trump. The modern Republican Party may be particularly apt to push conspiracy 
        theories to rationalize its complicity with a staggeringly corrupt administration, but this is an extension of, 
        not a break from, a much longer history. Since its very beginning, in the 1950s, members of the modern conservative 
        movement have justified bad behavior by convincing themselves that the other side is worse. One of the binding 
        agents holding the conservative coalition together over the course of the past half century has been an opposition 
        to liberalism, socialism, and global communism built on the suspicion, sometimes made explicit, that there’s no 
        real difference among them.

        <p>So, as you can see, the misconceptions surrounding the term "Liberal" & what these 
            kind individuals stand for, have simply been born from misplaced hatred & the increasingly 
            detrimental pandemic that is misinformation. Liberals are merely those who wish to 
            help their fellow human beings, & will continue to do so, no matter the cost . . . . . . .</p>
