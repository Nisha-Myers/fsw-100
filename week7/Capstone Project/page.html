        We're what we call, an activist assistance program, & we created this organization because we believe in 
        the progression of not just the U.S., but the world! Here, we care about you & your Cause... & we want 
        to help you get going & getting your Movement moving! <b>THE WORLD NEEDS PEOPLE LIKE YOU!!!</b> Without 
        empathetic go-getters like yourself the term "progression" would be entirely meaningless. 
        <br>It's <b>YOU</b> who fight for our rights! It's <b>YOU</b> who fight to keep our current rights intact! 
        It's <b>YOU</b> who speak out for those without a voice! It's <b>YOU</b> who give to those who have nothing, 
        even when you have nothing to give!<br>
        Keep fighting for effective policies that treat everyone with dignity &  respect! Sadly, the exremely negative 
        rhetoric & policies from the Right have been breaking our legitimate positive reputation & continue to increase 
        in consistency & severity...<br>
        Liberals have a lengthy record of environmental protection. Our natural environment
        is precious & it's our duty to heal & protect it!<br>
        Liberals don't just live for today. They don't want to live in the past... like some. They're always 
        considering our tomorrow by way of our environment, technology, education, rights, & progression as a 
        whole...<br>
        Liberals believe in working with our friends across the world to make our WORLD a better place
        for all! Liberals see Nationalism as being selfish, & completely illogical. We have to work 
        together if we ever want to move forward.<br>
        Liberalism means standing up for Human Rights!!! Believing that every. single. individual. 
        deserves equal rights, freedom, & treament. Unfortunately, in too many countries, across the 
        Globe, being LGBT+ or a woman means you don't have equal opportunities, or even basic Human 
        Rights! But Liberals fight for those who aren't able, or allowed to fight for themselves!<br>
        People from all over the world bring enormous benifits to our Country by way of our economy, 
        culture, & community. Liberals don't merely recognize the benifits of Immigration, they celebrate 
        them! They fight for effective policies that treat everyone with dignity & respect. Sadly, the 
        exremely negative rhetoric & policies from the Right that have broken our Immigration 
        system continue to increase in consistency & severity.

            Let's face it, our world & our Democracy as a whole is under attack. The so called "strongmen" 
            of this world are doing everything in their power to take our Freedoms & our Rights away from 
            us! <b>We cannot let that happen friends!</b> We have to keep our Path of Progression intact... 
            And the only way to do that is by taking action <b>NOW</b>!!!<br>
            The depressing truth of the state of Democracy around the world is that it is in terrible
            danger! The United States "electing" a Dictator Sympathizer has only exacerbated the situation...
            Trump coddled & cozied up to every Tyrannical, Authoritarian, Dictator he could get his hands on.
            Emboldening the so called "Strong Men" of the world to increase their attacks on Democracy.<br>
            But Liberals champion the Democratic rights of ALL individuals. They play a vital role in creating
            a fairer, more equal world... And not just verbally, but through passionate ACTION!!!<br>
            There is a creeping rise of Authoritarianismacross the Globe & something must be done to stop it! 
            With Russia's disinformation campaign in 2016 that seems to have continued to spread & worsen by the 
            day. Democracy seems to be hanging by a thread... & something must be done... NOW!!!    
            You're our modern <b>HERO'S</b> & we would love to be part of your pogressive movement...
