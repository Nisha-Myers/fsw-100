            <dt><b>What do you aspire to be in the web developer field? Where do you aspire to work?</b></dt>
            <dd>I aspire to have my own buisness... to create & run my own website helping Left-leaning 
                activists in their various Causes. Helping them collaborate with one another... Helping 
                them build their Movements... Helping them advertise/publisize their Causes... & helping 
                them get together to plan events & protests!</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>How do you plan to build on your current traits and skills throughout your program?</b></dt>
            <dd>I really want to improve my flexbox & grid abilities... But around the end of the course, I 
                started to get a handle on things! But I always feel like I can improve anything I attempt 
                in my life.
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Which topic, activity, or assignment did you enjoy the most? What did you learn by creating 
                or doing this activity?</b></dt>
            <dd>It's difficult to say... But I think CSS would have to be my all time favorite language! 
                I learned just how creative one can really be in this line of work, which is perfect for me, 
                because I've always been "a creative type". So I may tend to overdo it with CSS at times, but 
                it's just been so enjoyable & fun to play with! I was always so excited when we got to play 
                around with CSS in our assignments. 
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>What was your biggest accomplishment in the course?</b></dt>
            <dd>I think it was my "Capstone Project"... I created TEN seperate webpages, successfully building 
                my very first version of what will hopefully become my "Activist Assistance" Organaization!</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>What insights have you gained as a result of this course?</b></dt>
            <dd>That my dream of running my own company may very well be realized one day!</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b> does the information you've learned apply to your future goals?</b></dt>
            <dd>Well, as I stated, everything I've learned in this class is vital to the creation of my dream 
                business! With everything I've already learned, I believe I'm just about ready!!!</dd>
